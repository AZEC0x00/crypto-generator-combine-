# crypto generator combine
Generators and search for wallets with balances of different cryptocurrencies 

Overview
This Python script is designed to brute-force generate Binance Coin (BNB) wallet addresses and check their balances using the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) API. The script generates private keys, derives corresponding public keys and BNB addresses, and then checks the balance of each generated address. If a wallet with a non-zero balance is found, the details are saved to a file.

Disclaimer: This script is intended for educational purposes only. Brute-forcing cryptocurrency wallets is generally considered unethical and may be illegal. Use this script responsibly and only on wallets you own or have explicit permission to test.
